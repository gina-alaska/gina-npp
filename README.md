Pytroll
=======

A collection of python based tools for playing with satellite data. 

This gina-pytroll repo is my (@dayne) attempt at learning the peices
and how to set them up for my usage at GINA. 

A break down on what I'm trying to provide here:
* the tools involved, their websites, the location of the code
* a fairly generic recipe for installing the tools together
* lower barrier for a quick start install

I'm not trying to recreate a how-to-use these tools.  See their project
websites and their documentation for that.
